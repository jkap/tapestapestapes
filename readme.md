# TAPESTAPESTAPES
### Let's talk about real shit
I'm going to assume, for simplicity's sake, that everyone here knows what Muxtape is/was. For those of you who don't, Wikipedia is [this way.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muxtape)

Right now, we use [NiftyPlayer](http://www.varal.org/media/niftyplayer/) with a custom coded playlist handling system. This kinda sucks, though, and we're working on switching to [SoundManager 2](http://www.schillmania.com/projects/soundmanager2/).
